Hacker Rank -> Algorithms -> Warm up -> The Love Letter Mystery

Problem Statement:

Change all the input words into palindromes by 
noting down the number of changes that have to be
made.

In order to form a palindrome, one has to repeatedly 
reduce the value of a letter. This can be done until the letter 
becomes 'a'. Once a letter has been changed to 'a', it can no 
longer be changed.

Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. 
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given 
string into a palindrome. 

Input format:

The first line contains an integer T, i.e., the number of test cases. 
The next T lines will contain a string each. The strings do not contain any spaces.

Output format:
Single line containing number of changes
