HackerRank -> Algorithms -> Implementation -> Utopian Tree

Problem Statement

The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. 
The first growth cycle occurs during the spring, when it doubles in height. 
The second growth cycle occurs during the summer, when its height increases by 1 meter. 
Now, a new Utopian Tree sapling is planted at the onset of spring. Its height is 1 meter. 
Can you find the height of the tree after N growth cycles?

Input Format: First line contains number of test cases. Subsequent lines contain the inputs in int format
